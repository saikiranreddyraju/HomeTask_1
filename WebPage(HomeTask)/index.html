        <p class="para">India is seen to slow to 6.5 per cent in the fiscal year starting April but will remain the
            fastest growing major economy in the world as it fared better in dealing with the extraordinary set of
            challenges the world faced, the Economic Survey 2022-23 tabled on Tuesday said. The survey sees GDP
            growth of 6.5 per cent in 2023-24 compared with an estimated 7 per cent expansion this fiscal (April
            2022 to March 2023) and 8.7 per cent in the previous year.

        <p class="reporting">posted on 29 january,2023.</p>
        <p class="para">Shares of Adani Group companies remained under pressure for the third straight session on
            Monday with majority of them witnessing a crash yet again. The deepening market rout has now led to
            losses worth $65 billion in the group's stock values, according to a Reuters report. The current round
            of fall follows a report by Hindenburg Research last week which flagged concerns about the conglomerates
            debt levels and the use of tax havens.
